# CHANGELOG — Olivier Scholarship Guide

Version history moved out of CLAUDE.md in v35.2 (July 2026) to reduce per-session context cost — CLAUDE.md is read at the start of every session; this file is read only when history is needed.

**Phase 8 (End of Session Protocol) appends new version entries here — add them at the TOP of the history below.** Entries under the divider are preserved in their original CLAUDE.md order (roughly chronological with some grouping).

---


### v21 Stable — May 28 2026
All v21 work complete and live. See the V21_Upgrade_Plan.docx for full specification.
- v21.0: olivier.json consolidation (data/olivier.json deleted)
- v21.1: Minutes Outlook populated for 19 schools; Georgetown + Notre Dame upgraded to full profile
- v21.2: Fit Score rebalanced with Minutes Outlook 20%; dual score mode toggle; JUCO 0.75; GPA projection slider
- v21 UX: Shortlist status tags; Coach Outreach Tracker; Animated pill tabs on Coaches page

### v22 Stable — June 2026
Five new full-profile schools added: Mercyhurst (NEC/D1), Georgian Court (CACC/D2), Columbia College MO (D3), Northeast CC (JUCO), Monroe College (JUCO).

**Architecture changes in v22:**
- PT Pathway removed from scoring entirely: devScores now 3 keys (tactical/technical/fitness), lensScores now 6 keys (pt removed), LENSES array has 6 entries (PT Pathway removed), Fit Score ptPath weight = 0 in both modes
- CONF_SECTIONS split: `divFilter:'D3JUCO'` replaced with separate D3 and JUCO sections (both use `confKey:'other'`)
- Sort/Lens/Mode redesigned as independent axes: Best Fit sort is lens-aware; lens applies highlights only; mode toggle re-applies current sort
- Overall Fit description now uses `u.rec` (school-specific) instead of generic static text
- Glossary updated: all PT Pathway references removed

### v23 Stable — June 2026
Data verification pass, financial model correction, and coach data completion.

**Data fixes in v23:**
- CAA confRecord verified standings for 5 schools: William & Mary, Northeastern, Elon, Monmouth, Stony Brook (2020–2025)
- Big Ten confRecord corrected: MSU 2025 10th, MSU 2021 8th, Wisconsin 2021 6th, Illinois 2021 Independent
- Orphaned data/schools.json deleted (v15-era monolith, nothing loaded it)
- guideVersion bumped to v23 in athletes/olivier.json

**Minutes Outlook in v23:**
- minutesOutlook populated for Santa Monica College (JUCO) and Miami Dade College (JUCO)
- lensScores.minutes and lensScores.overall updated for both schools
- fitOlivier updated for SMC (79→80) and MDC (78→80)

**Coach data completion in v23:**
- 6 coaches added to coaches.json: Giuseppe DePalo (MDC), Lee Avery (SMC), Matt McArthur (Nova SE), Kylie Stannard (Yale), Dustin Johnson (Chapman), Michael Erush (Cal State LA)
- All 40 coaches re-ranked by overallScore descending
- Cal State LA full coaching staff documented (Michael Erush + 4 assistants)

**Financial model overhaul in v23:**
- Athletic scholarship slider corrected to 0–100% (full athletic ride = 100% of COA, not capped at 50%)
- Academic/institutional aid restructured as fixed dollar amount ($0–$30k), not a percentage
- Scenario buttons updated: Full Ride = 100% athletic, Typical Intl = 35% + $10k institutional
- Glossary: new "How Scholarships Work" section with equivalency explanation and D2 Florida stacking example
- Corrected misleading internationalNote text for SMU, Wake Forest, UCLA

**Tools added in v23:**
- export_schools.py — exports all 95 schools to CSV for external review (excludes Olivier-specific fields)

### v32 Stable — June 2026
Cost display made dynamic. The `cost` JSON field was a static string that drifted from `fin.costNum` — 5 schools had displays $10–25k wrong.

**Changes in v32:**
- `costDisplay()` helper added to app.js — derives display from `fin.costNum` (e.g. `$69,664/yr`). Falls back to `u.cost` only if no `fin` data. Service academies (costNum=0) show "Fully funded".
- All 3 display locations updated: school card, Compare tab, modal Overview
- `cost` field in school JSON is now redundant for full-profile schools — do not manually maintain it
- **Deferred:** tuition/roomBoard/fees sub-fields for Tulsa, Nova SE, Oklahoma City, UC Irvine, Wisconsin don't add up to their v31-corrected costNum — need a dedicated COA research pass to fix components

### v33 — June 2026
COA pass #1. costNum corrected for 4 schools where stored value was stale vs official 2025-26 COA.

**Changes in v33:**
- UCI: costNum $72,796 → $81,292 (2025-26 federal COA; T+F $56,682 confirmed Tier-1 via UCI Registrar; roomBoard $19,500 estimated from 2026-27 housing rates)
- Georgetown: costNum $100,864 → $97,264 (confirmed from Georgetown Financial Aid 2025-26 undergraduate COA page)
- Tulsa: costNum $69,664 → $77,346 (confirmed from UTulsa federal COA 2025-26 page; now includes university fees + indirect costs)
- OCU: costNum $49,262 → $56,720 (estimated from 2026-27 official COA of $57,120 minus $400 housing reduction for 2025-26)
- Tulsa fitOlivier 77→70 (recalculated from current data; costScore 0.15→0.10 floor). lensScores.value 37→46.
- OCU fitOlivier 69→68 (costScore 0.596→0.426). lensScores.value 68→58.
- UCI and Georgetown fitOlivier/scores unchanged (costScore already at 0.10 floor).
- guideVersion bumped to v33.

**Deferred from v33:**
- COA pass #2: 12 round-number costNum estimates (Penn State, Rutgers, Maryland, Creighton, Butler, DePaul, Marquette, UC Riverside, UCSD, William & Mary, Drexel, Vermont)
- UCI roomBoard ($19,500) and total COA ($81,292) are estimates — UCI financial aid site (financialaid.uci.edu) blocked WebFetch (ECONNREFUSED); verify via Chrome MCP browser
- OCU 2025-26 costNum is estimated (2025-26 official page rolled to 2026-27 data)

### v32.1 — June 2026
COA component audit. All 17 schools where tuition+roomBoard+fees ≠ costNum were researched and fixed using official school/financial aid pages (Tier 1 only).

**Changes in v32.1:**
- Components corrected for 17 schools across 8 conference files: Cal, Duke, SMU, UNC, Notre Dame, Louisville (ACC); Princeton, Yale (Ivy); Wisconsin, Indiana (Big Ten); Georgetown (Big East); Tulsa (AAC); OCU, Nova SE (D2/NAIA); Monroe, Indian Hills (JUCO); UC Irvine (Big West)
- `fees` field now absorbs all indirect costs (books, personal, transport, health insurance, international fees) to make components sum exactly to `costNum`
- Princeton uses 2026-27 data (deliberate — Olivier's actual enrollment year)
- 3 schools had costNum discrepancies vs official 2025-26 COA (Georgetown, Tulsa, OCU) — kept existing costNums, made components sum to them
- UCI costNum ($72,796) is stale vs 2025-26 actual (~$81k) — noted, kept as-is; tuition updated to $56,682 (official 2025-26 nonresident t+f)

### v24 Stable — June 2026
internationalNote populated for all schools, new JUCO school added, coaching licence data introduced.

**Changes in v24:**
- internationalNote added to all 54 remaining schools
- APP_VERSION now driven dynamically from `athleteConfig.guideVersion` in olivier.json
- Indian Hills CC (Ottumwa, IA) added as full-profile JUCO school — 2025 NJCAA DI National Champions
- coaching `licence` field added to all 41 coaches.json entries — 25 confirmed, 16 null
- Licence badge displayed on coach cards and rankings table
- guideVersion bumped to v24 in athletes/olivier.json

### v25 Stable — June 2026
All 55 listed-profile schools upgraded to full-profile. FSU removed (no men's soccer program). 95 coaches in coaches.json.

**Commits:**
- v25.1–v25.2: ACC batch (Duke, NC State, Louisville, Pitt, Stanford, Syracuse, Cal) — 7 schools
- v25.3: Big East batch (Villanova, Marquette + prior 7) — 9 schools complete
- v25.4: Big West batch (Cal Poly, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Riverside, UC San Diego, Long Beach, Hawaii, CSUF) — 8 schools
- v25.5: AAC batch (Tulsa, Memphis, Temple, East Carolina, UAB, Navy, Army, Charlotte, Rice) — 10 schools
- v25.6: CAA batch (William & Mary, Hofstra, Northeastern, Drexel, Delaware, Elon, Monmouth, Stony Brook) — 8 schools
- v25.7: Vermont (America East) upgraded
- v25.8: FSU removed; Conference tab desc/olivierNote updated across all conferences

**Total guide schools as of v25: 95 coaches, all schools full-profile.**

### v26 Stable — June 2026
ACU Alignment tab overhaul. Minutes Outlook formula and JUCO calibration fixes. Wichita State and Hawaii removed (no men's soccer programs). Coach name research continued.

**Commits:**
- v26.1–v26.2: Replace placeholder coaches with real names (16 total across multiple conferences)
- v26.3: Remove Wichita State and Hawaii (no men's soccer programs confirmed)
- v26.4: UC Riverside — Tim Cupello coach update
- v26.5–v26.6: Conference tab fix (conf-prestige.json programsInGuide corrections)
- v26.7–v26.9: ACU Alignment tab overhaul — stale cards fixed, JUCOs excluded
- v26.10–v26.12: Minutes Outlook — JUCO adjusted factor 1.2, Yr1+Yr2 ranking, calibration
- v26.13: CLAUDE.md — minutesOutlook roster research now mandatory Step 7 in Change Type 8

**Architecture decisions in v26:**
- JUCOs excluded from ACU Alignment tab — WES alignment not applicable for 2yr programs
- Minutes Outlook ranking uses Yr1+Yr2 only
- JUCO adjusted factor set to 1.2 — Olivier above average in JUCO player pool

**Deferred from v26 (carry to v27):**
- 53 schools with minutesOutlook `available:false` — populate from roster data
- Remaining "Head Coach" placeholder names unresolved
- GCU coach verification (Jamie Davies Dec 2025 flag)
- Remaining coaching licences unconfirmed (null)
- SMU shortlist decision (borderline budget reach)

**Planned for v27:**
- ~~Add Tyler Junior College~~ — ALREADY IN GUIDE (id: tyler_jc, data/juco.json). Needs data quality pass: costNum correction ($14k→$22.2k), confRecord with actual standings, titles[] with 6 national championships, domain fix (tjc.edu→apacheathletics.com), coach email/phone verification
- ~~Add Daytona State College~~ — ALREADY IN GUIDE (id: daytona_state, data/juco.json)
- minutesOutlook — populate from roster data for schools still at available:false

### v33.2 — July 2026
Spot-check fix: Mercyhurst 2025 confRecord (Change Type 6).

**Changes in v33.2:**
- `data/d1-other.json` — Mercyhurst 2025 confRecord corrected. Was showing placeholder `"pos": "—"` for the school's first D1 NEC season; official NEC standings (necsports.com, Tier 1) confirm Mercyhurst finished 8th of 10 (3-5-1, 10 pts, 3-10-4 overall), did not clinch a tournament berth. Note updated accordingly.
- lensScores.soccer left unchanged — the documented formula ((devAvg × 0.6) + (mlsPicks5yr/10 × 0.3) + (divStrength × 0.1)) does not derive from confRecord standings, so no cascade applies.
- guideVersion bumped to v33.2 in athletes/olivier.json.

**Lesson for future sessions:** newly-D1-reclassified schools (Mercyhurst-style) should not default to a placeholder dash for their first season once that season has concluded — check the conference's official standings page even when the note says "first season" or similar, since results are usually published well before the next spot-check.

### v35 — July 2026
Four new full-profile JUCO schools added: Barton Community College, Cowley County Community College, Arizona Western College, Eastern Florida State College. `data/juco.json` now has 12 schools (was 8).

**Changes in v35:**
- `data/juco.json` — 4 new full-profile school objects added: `barton_cc` (NJCAA DI/KJCCC, Great Bend KS), `cowley_cc` (NJCAA DI/KJCCC, Arkansas City KS), `arizona_western` (NJCAA DI/ACCAC, Yuma AZ), `efsc` (NJCAA DI/FCSAA Region 8, Melbourne FL). All fields populated per §5 schema: acuUnits[16], lensScores[6], minutesOutlook (roster-researched via Chrome MCP for Barton, WebFetch fallback for the other 3 after a Claude-in-Chrome extension per-origin permission block), fitOlivier.
- `data/coaches.json` — 4 coaches added (Rafael Simmons/Barton, Marcos Vinicius Longo Ribeiro/Cowley, Kenny Dale/AWC, Bart Sasnett/EFSC). All 93 coaches re-ranked by overallScore descending via a one-off `add_juco_coaches.py` script (deleted after use — not part of the permanent toolset).
- `js/app.js` — DOMAINS, SITE_URLS, SOCIAL updated for all 4 schools; existing JUCO CONF_SECTIONS entry's intro text updated (no new section needed — `confKey:'other'`/`divFilter:'JUCO'` already existed).
- `data/conferences.json` — JUCO entry's guideSchools[], desc, and olivierNote updated (8 → 12 schools).
- `data/conf-prestige.json` — JUCO entry's programsInGuide and relevance updated.
- `python validate_schools.py` passes — 93 schools total, only expected warnings (missing coach email/phone, matches existing JUCO pattern since no official contact info is published for any of the 4).

**Research notes:**
- Roster data (minutesOutlook) confirmed 100% turnover before Olivier's August 2027 start at all 4 schools, consistent with existing JUCO pattern. `recruit_pathway` populated as "Freshman-friendly" for all 4 based on roster composition (majority true freshmen, not transfer/portal-sourced) — this is the first batch where `recruit_pathway` (schema added v34) was actually populated.
- Multi-year confRecord (2021-2024) is incomplete for all 4 — only 2025-26 season standings were confirmed at Tier 1 sources (KJCCC/ACCAC/FCSAA official sites) within this session's scope; older years marked "exact standings not researched this session" rather than guessed, following the precedent already set for Daytona State in this same file.
- No coach email/phone published on any of the 4 schools' official athletics sites — all four `coach.email`/`coach.phone` fields are `null` (documented, not guessed).

**Tooling note discovered this session:** the Claude-in-Chrome browser extension enforces its own per-origin permission grant, separate from `.claude/settings.json`/`settings.local.json` (which only gate the `WebFetch` tool and MCP tool-call permission, not browser `navigate`). When `navigate` returns "Navigation to this domain is not allowed" for a domain never visited in-session, `WebFetch` is a reliable fallback for static/server-rendered pages (works well for Sidearm Sports roster tables) even though it won't render heavy client-side JS.

- guideVersion bumped to v35 in athletes/olivier.json.

### v35.1 — July 2026
Fit Score formula: ACU Alignment weight zeroed for JUCO schools (architecture decision, owner-directed).

**Why:** A JUCO degree is a 2-year stepping stone to a 4-year transfer, not the actual pathway-relevant credential — scoring it against ACU units conflated "this specific 2yr program aligns" with "this school is a good JUCO fit," which it wasn't really measuring. Owner decision: zero out ACU Alignment for JUCO schools, redistribute the freed weight to Minutes Outlook (+5%) and Climate (+5%), since playing time and lifestyle are what actually differentiate JUCO options. GPA Eligibility weight left unchanged — even though it always scores full marks for JUCOs (all guide JUCOs are open-enrolment), that's an accurate reflection of reality, not a bug, so no redistribution needed there.

**Changes in v35.1:**
- `js/scores.js` — new `effectiveWeights(school, athlete)` helper: for `div==='JUCO'` schools, sets `acuAlignment` weight to 0 and adds the freed amount to `minutesOutlook` (if active — With Minutes mode) split evenly with `climate`; in Base Fit mode (no Minutes factor), the full freed amount goes to `climate` alone. `calculateFitScore()` and `buildScoreBreakdown()` (the modal's Score Breakdown tooltip) both use this helper, so the weights displayed in the tooltip and the score computed always match for JUCO schools. Non-JUCO schools are completely unaffected — `effectiveWeights()` returns `athlete.scoreWeights` unchanged when `acuAlignment` weight is already 0 or `div !== 'JUCO'`.
- **New JUCO weight table (With Minutes mode):** Soccer Level 20% + GPA Eligibility 20% + Cost 20% + ACU Alignment **0%** + Minutes Outlook **25%** (was 20%) + City 5% + Climate **10%** (was 5%) = 100%.
- `data/juco.json` — `fitOlivier`, `lensScores.overall`, and `lensScores.value` recalculated and re-stored for all 12 JUCO schools to match the new formula (Change Type 5 cascade — a scoring-weight change requires all affected fitOlivier/lensScores.overall to be recalculated and re-stored, scoped here to `div==='JUCO'` only since the formula change itself is JUCO-conditional). `lensScores.academic` (a separate, independent lens) and `acuAlign`/`acuUnits[]` (informational, per the existing JUCO ACU exception in Change Type 9) were **not** touched — only fitOlivier-derived fields moved.
- `index.html` — Glossary tab's Fit Score card expanded with an explicit side-by-side weight breakdown for non-JUCO vs JUCO schools, including the GPA-always-eligible caveat for JUCOs, so the displayed methodology matches the actual code.

**Tabs verified:** Explore Schools (JUCO fit scores updated live, non-JUCO fit scores unchanged — spot-checked FIU 82%, Clemson 53%, Virginia 49% all unaffected), Glossary tab (new breakdown renders correctly), Score Breakdown tooltip (JUCO schools now show ACU Alignment 0% row). Zero console errors.



**Origin:** FIU roster research (v34 session) found ~60–70% of midfield roster spots filled via transfer/JUCO portal rather than true incoming freshmen, and that true-freshman internationals who did make the roster generally carried a pro-academy/club pedigree. This is a different axis from the existing GPA-based `internationalNote` (academic admission ease) — a school can be easy to get *admitted* to and still hard to win a freshman *roster spot* at.

**What shipped in v34 (this session):** schema-only. `recruit_pathway` / `recruit_pathway_note` added to the `minutesOutlook{}` field reference (§5), a research step added to Phase 1G (§7), and a companion note added to Change Type 3 (§3a). **No data was populated** — not even FIU. Populating any school's `recruit_pathway` is deferred to the full pass below.

**Next focus area — full recruiting-pathway pass across all 95 schools:**
- Research and populate `recruit_pathway` / `recruit_pathway_note` for every full-profile school, starting with FIU (data already gathered in the v34 research session — see conversation, not yet transcribed to JSON)
- Decide whether to batch this by conference (matching the existing Change Type 8 batching pattern) or run it as a standalone pass
- Informational only for now — no scoring cascade (see open question below)

**Open question — does this belong in the Fit model at all?** Owner flagged (v34) that "fit" and "realistic likelihood of immediate entry" may be two different things the current single `fitOlivier` score conflates, and is not yet sure how to model that distinction. Do not attempt to fold `recruit_pathway` into `fitOlivier`/`lensScores.minutes` until this is explicitly resolved — possible directions to evaluate when this is picked up: (a) a second, separate "entry likelihood" score shown alongside fitOlivier rather than blended into it, (b) a dampening factor applied only to `lensScores.minutes` for Portal/JUCO-heavy schools, (c) leave purely informational (current default). Needs owner input before any scoring change — this is a model-design decision, not a data-entry task.
