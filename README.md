## Viewing the Guide

### Option A — GitHub Pages (recommended, live URL)

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main → / (root) → Save**
3. Your guide is live at `https://yourusername.github.io/olivier-guide/`

### Option B — Local development server

Browsers block `fetch()` calls from `file://` URLs for security reasons.  
You must use a local server. The easiest way:

```bash
# If you have Node.js installed:
npx serve .

# If you have Python installed:
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

> ⚠️ **Do not just double-click index.html** — it will show a data load error because the browser cannot fetch the JSON files from a local file path.

## Adding or Updating a School

All school data lives in `data/schools.json`. Each school is one object in the array.

### To update an existing school (e.g. update a coach's email):

1. Open `data/schools.json` in GitHub (click the file → click the pencil ✏️ icon)
2. Find the school by its `id` field (e.g. `"id": "pba"`)
3. Edit the relevant field
4. Click **Commit changes**
5. The live site updates within 30 seconds

### To add a new school:

1. Open `data/schools.json`
2. Copy an existing school object (from `{` to the closing `},`)
3. Paste it before the final `]`
4. Fill in all fields — see the field reference below
5. Commit changes

## Technical Notes

- Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript — no frameworks, no build step required
- Google Fonts (Outfit + Lora) loaded via CDN — requires internet connection to display correctly
- All data fetched via `fetch()` — requires a server (GitHub Pages or local server)
- Single `<script src="js/app.js">` tag in index.html loads all logic
- Data arrays (`unis`, `conferences`, `coachData`) are declared as globals in app.js and populated asynchronously on load
